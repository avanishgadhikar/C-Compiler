# Building a compiler consisting of a lexer->parser->code generator.

GOAL of project: This a completely learning based project. To build a compiler from scratch without using the library functions. 
1. The end goal of the compiler is to be able to implement FizzBuzz on its own.
2. This will include implementation of loops and conditional statements.
3. This will also include a basic implementation of arithmetic operators.
4. Also an implementation of the modulo operator.


Current progress: Can compile a fizzbuzz code given in the examples!

PS: This could not have been possible without CobbCoding's video series on the compiler from scratch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4RmhDy0A2s&list=PLRnI_2_ZWhtA_ZAzEa8uJF8wgGF0HjjEz&ab_channel=CobbCoding
